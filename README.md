iceflow turns links on the web pages to video hosting services like YouTube into inline video player.

It is written using **extension-grill** framework and will support Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera and Safari desktop browsers in the future. Currently I'm focused on stabilizing Opera version, Chrome will come next very soon.

Stay tuned!
